It contains sentences labelled with positive or negative sentiment, extracted from reviews of products, movies, and restaurants


Details:
Score is either 1 (for positive) or 0 (for negative)  	
The sentences come from three different websites/fields:  

imdb.com, amazon.com, yelp.com  

For each website, there exist 500 positive and 500 negative sentences. Those were selected randomly for larger datasets of reviews. 
We attempted to select sentences that have a clearly positive or negative connotaton, the goal was for no neutral sentences to be selected.
